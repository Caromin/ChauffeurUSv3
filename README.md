Problems found that need to be resolved still:

1. ~~Link tags in react-router-dom are updating the url, but not the re-render.~~ Solved.

   How: Switch Routing was causing only one component to render and blocking nav links.

---

Remaining Issues:

- Better validation checks before registering.
- match() need to be placed somewhere else, causing errors.
- Need to update login to display errors when not successful.

---

Notes:

- nodemon in package.json cancels the component auto refresh, node allows it to update auto without manual refresh.

* Must disable hot module in app.js for production, I believe webpack is fine, but if manual refresh, webpack will rebundle and page will update even though it shouldnt.

---

Ignored files:

- node_modules, dist (generates the webpack bundle.js)
